### About

Physics 5810 Computational physics lab file dump.

The following description is courtesy of the [OSU website](https://physics.osu.edu/courses/physics-5810):

Experimental and theoretical aspects of areas of current interest in Computational Physics.


The goal of the course is to make every student comfortable in addressing physics problems using
computational methods. Given that in contrast to the physics textbook's end-of-chapter problems,
hardly any real life problems can be solved using pencil and paper, being comfortable using
computational methods is a very important skill for every physicist. Being comfortable addressing
physics problems with computers means knowing how to write good code, but also understanding the
shortfalls of computational algorithms, and how to evaluate a computation's results for plausibility rather
than just believing that everything that comes out of a computer must be correct. The course will
address all these issues. In addition, we will hopefully also learn a bit of interesting physics that can
only be addressed computationally; it is a physics course after all! Since the only way to learn
computation is by doing, lecturing will be minimal and most of the class time will be spent hands on
working through worksheets on the computers in the classroom (or your own).

The course will cover the following topics:
* Unix environment and how to write a computer program
* Rounding errors in floating point arithmetic
* Using scientific computing libraries
* Numerical differentiation and integration
* Solving Linear algebra, differential equations, and quantum mechanics problems with programming
* Parallel processing
* Oscillations, pendulums, and chaos
* Debugging, optimizing, and profiling
* Random numbers and Monte Carlo methods
* Ising model
